# Switch Mode Tool

This script automates the management of both the Powerwallâ€™s operating mode and reserve settings to optimize energy usage and grid export. It is designed for scenarios where you want to:

- **Automatically switch from self-consumption (Self-Powered) to autonomous (Time-Based Control) mode** when the battery is sufficiently charged (above `TRIGGER_RESERVE`). This enables exporting excess energy to the grid during peak times.
- **Set the reserve level to `EXPORT_RESERVE`** before switching to export mode, ensuring enough battery is available for export.
- **Return to self-consumption mode** when the battery drops below `EXPORT_RESERVE` or when peak export time ends (as defined by `OFF_PEAK_CUTOFF`).
- **Set the reserve level to `BACKUP_RESERVE`** when returning to self-consumption, preserving battery for backup use.
- **Continuously monitor and correct the reserve setting** if it is changed externally or between script runs, ensuring the reserve matches the intended mode.

## Setup

1. Setup Control APIs - released in v4.3.1 [RELEASE.md v4.3.1 - Control APIs](../../RELEASE.md#v431---control-apis)

```bash
# Setup cloud mode for pypowerwall container
docker exec -it pypowerwall python3 -m pypowerwall setup -email=example@example.com

MODE=self_consumption
RESERVE=20
PW_CONTROL_SECRET=mySecretKey

# Set Mode
curl -X POST -d "value=$MODE&token=$PW_CONTROL_SECRET" http://localhost:8675/control/mode

# Set Reserve
curl -X POST -d "value=$RESERVE&token=$PW_CONTROL_SECRET" http://localhost:8675/control/reserve

# Read Settings
curl http://localhost:8675/control/mode
curl http://localhost:8675/control/reserve
```

2. Ensure dependencies are installed:
   - `curl`
   - `jq`
   - `bc`

3. Configure `switch-mode.conf` with your API endpoints, tokens, and thresholds.


## Configuration

Edit `switch-mode.conf` to set:
- `PYPOWERWALL`: pyPowerwall API endpoint
- `TOKEN`: Secret token required to call the endpoint
- `LOGFILE`: Log file path
- `NTFY_URL`: Notification URL
- `NTFY_SOS_URL`: SOS notification URL
- `TRIGGER_RESERVE`, `EXPORT_RESERVE`, `BACKUP_RESERVE`: Reserve thresholds
- `OFF_PEAK_CUTOFF`: Off-peak cutoff time
- `DEBUG`: Set to `true` for verbose output

## Usage

Run the script:
```sh
zsh switch-mode.zsh
```

## Automation (Crontab)

To run the script every day between 5pm and 7pm (17:00-19:00), add this to your crontab:
```cron
* 17-19 * * * <user>    /<path to script>/switch-mode.sh >> /tmp/powerwall-mode-cron.log 2>&1
```

## What It Does
- Checks battery level and reserve via pypowerwall API
- Switches between autonomous and self-consumption modes based on thresholds
- Updates reserve settings as needed
- Sends notifications on mode/reserve changes and errors
- Logs all API responses

## Example Output
```
Current mode: self_consumption
Current reserve: 20
Powerwall battery level: 100
App battery level: 100
Setting reserve to: 55
Setting mode to: autonomous
```

## Error Handling
- Exits if required configuration is missing or Powerwall is unreachable
- Logs failures and sends SOS notifications if battery level cannot be read
